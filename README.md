# 🚀 Intelligent Mob Surveillance System using AI, DevOps & Blockchain

An AI-powered intelligent CCTV surveillance framework designed to automatically detect suspicious mob activities in real-time and ensure **tamper-proof storage of digital evidence** using blockchain-based cryptographic security.

---

## 🌐 Live System (Local DevOps Deployment)

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional CCTV surveillance systems depend on continuous human monitoring and use centralized storage systems where video evidence can be modified, deleted, or tampered with.

This compromises the reliability of digital forensic evidence.

The **Intelligent Mob Surveillance System (IMS)** solves this by integrating:

* 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (real-time detection)
* ⚙️ DevOps (automated deployment)
* 🔐 Blockchain (tamper-proof evidence storage)

---

## 🔥 Key Features

* 🎥 Real-time CCTV / webcam monitoring
* 🧠 AI-based mob detection (YOLOv8)
* 📊 Person counting & crowd analysis
* 🚨 Suspicious activity detection (threshold-based)
* 🔐 AES-256 encryption of video evidence
* 🧾 SHA-256 hash generation
* ⛓️ Blockchain-based immutable logging
* 🔄 CI/CD automated deployment (Jenkins + Docker)
* 🌐 API-based microservices architecture
